This python script examines the neighbours of a polygon (buildings) shapefile and draws red points on each polygon with more than one neighbour using PyQGIS.

Kindly take note of the location of your data and the location of the QGIS project. Ideally, in the root location of the QGIS Project file (.qgz), there should be a folder named ```Output``` with the  polygon shapefile.

To run the script, open the QGIS project and open the python console, create a new file and paste all the code and run the script. Alternatively, on the python console and open this script.

#TODO
